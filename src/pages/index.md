  description: I have a passion for technology. I love to engineer optimal
    solutions using the latest cutting edge technology and recommendations.
description: I'm currently interested and exploring JAMSTACK. This site is built
  on a JAMSTACK, GatsbyJS front-end, Golang back-end (serverless functions). 
  It is easy to go from an idea to live on the web when utilizing a
  JAMSTACK. I really enjoy the experience as a developer who doesn't want to be
  spending a lot of time messing with server or container configs, security
  certificates, and other task that are eliminated when utilizing a JAMSTACK.
  It is fast to develop in, performant, and very flexible once you learn the 
  newaunces.
