  description: I have a passion for technology. I love to engineer unique
    solutions with new ideas and tools.
description: I'm currently interested and exploring JAMSTACK. This site is built
  using a JAMSTACK, GatsbyJS front-end and Golang serverless functions for the
  back-end - no DB currently, but utilizing netlify auth and a few other
  services. It is easy to go from an idea to live on the web when utilizing a
  JAMSTACK. I really enjoy the experience as a developer who doesn't want to be
  spending a bunch of time messing with server or container configs, security
  certificates, and other task that are eliminated when utilizing a JAMSTACK.
