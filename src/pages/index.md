  description: Technology is my passion. I thrive on logically engineering optimal solutions by incorporating cutting edge technology.
description: I am currently exploring the application of JAMSTACK. This site is built using JAMSTACK, GatsbyJS for the front-end, and serverless functions using Golang for the back-end. Utilizing JAMSTACK developers can efficiently bring ideas to life. As a developer, I appreciate spending less time with server configurations, security certificates, and other tasks that are mostly eliminated. JAMSTACK yields speedy development, excellent performance, and is quite flexible once you learn the mechanics.
